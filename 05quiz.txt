## 1) What does MVCr stand for?


___Model-View-Controller-routes



## 2) In what file do we store 'r' from MVCr ?


___config/routes.rb



## 3) What two components make up a route

___HTTP Verb
___URL



## 4) Why are Rails routes REST(ful) ?

___The state (HTTP verb) of the request determines what the server action will be. The same URL with a different verb has a different outcome




## 5) Match the data operations to the HTTP Verbs
[GET, POST, DELETE, PUT]

1) Create   ___POST
2) Read     ___GET
3) Update   ___PUT
4) Destroy  ___DELETE





## 6) Fill out the values below based on this log entry:

    Started GET "/products/new" for 127.0.0.1 at 2012-06-28 11:33:36 -0700
    Processing by ProductsController#new as HTML
      Rendered products/new.html.erb within layouts/application (0.4ms)
    Completed 200 OK in 11ms (Views: 9.3ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)


Was the request successful, why or why not? ___YES, the server sent the 200 response.
What view file was rendered? ___products/new.html.erb
What path was this request to ? ___/products/new
What Controller was used ? ___products





## 7) Build a route based on the log entry in the last exercise that maps from the correct url and verb to the correct controller and view.

get "/products/new" => "products#new"
