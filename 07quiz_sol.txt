## 5) Describe what a callback function is, explain why you would want to use one? What is the alternative to a callback function?


Callback functions are used in code when we don't want to wait for an event or we don't want to use polling to constantly check to see if an event has happened. We use callbacks so we can effectively use our code's time, and we don't have to block on waiting for events. 

One alternative to a callback function is polling ("are we there yet?").
